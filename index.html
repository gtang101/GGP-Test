					<h2>1. What a girl's life is like</h2>
					<p class="text-center">The girls who participate in the Global Girl Project Leadership Initiative are keen to make the most of all opportunities. They are resilient, determined and powerful.</p>
					<p class="text-center">However, they also face many challenges and barriers:</p>

					<h3>Isolation and lack of independence</h3>
					<p>Often, our girls experience a lack of independence and have limited access to the outside world. Many girls in India are not able to travel on their own to anything outside the house. The majority of our girls do not have their own phones so rely on fathers and brothers. Their worlds are often quite isolated, involving just school and home, and they have little access to extracurricular activities or the internet.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="col sequence-a">
					<h3>Gendered roles</h3>
					<p>Frequently girls are subject to gendered roles in society. This means they are typically expected to fill the role of a mother and a wife, or certain types of employment. Many girls do want to be mothers and wives. However, there are additional roles girls want to fill but cannot because of gendered expectations.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="col sequence-a">
					<h3>Political unrest and instability</h3>
					<p>Many girls, like our girls from Haiti, can be dealing with political unrest and instability which plays itself out in the form of violence in the streets.</p>

					<p>Girls are given an opportunity to become a part of the Global Girl Ecosystem for Social Change. They begin their journey with a 3-month leadership programme called the Global Girl Leadership Initiative and continue to become part of our Global Graduates Connect global network for social change.</p>
					<p>As part of the initial Global Girl Leadership Initiative, which runs for the first 12 weeks of the girls' journey, our girls have an opportunity to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>learn about leadership</li>
						<li>create a community project</li>
						<li>meet and connect with girls from other parts of the world</li>
						<li>participate in an international education program in their own language</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The girls engage in weekly 2-hour learning sessions over 12 weeks. Local partners deliver the curriculum using a single computer, with weekly videos subtitled in the local language. Girls participate in leadership activities, critical discussions, and research.</p>

				  <p>Global Girl Project encourages girls to think critically about their role in their community, including their experiences with religion, work, and home, the role of girls in their community and how it differs from men and boys. This is often the first time girls have been asked for their opinions on these subjects, and they often don't know how to share them openly.</p>
				  <p>Girls are asked about what issues they are interested in their communities and what they see that needs to be changed and they are encouraged to research and discuss issues they care about in their community. Global Girl Project does not advise on which issues to choose, ensuring that change comes from within the community. The girls then collaborate to select one issue and organise a community event, requiring discussion, compromise, and decision-making as a group.</p>

				  <h2>4. Redefinition of leadership and voice</h2>
				  <p>This part of our program helps girls to reframe who they perceive as leaders, and redefine leadership, moving beyond the common perception that only males or corrupt politicians are leaders. Through group and partner discussions, the girls discover that leadership means helping their communities, not having power over others and they are asked to share about people in their communities who demonstrate this. They watch videos about both local and international girls who are leading, and they do worksheets on the subject.</p>
				  <p>Most of our girls learn for the first time that there are very different ways to lead and that they are in fact already leaders in many ways.</p>
				  <p>They learn about different elements of voice, including listening, speaking, and writing, and are introduced to social media as a tool for change. Additionally, they practice listening, and speaking up for themselves and their ideas. This is often the first time they have been asked to stand up and speak for and about themselves.</p>

				<div class="text-content-container">
				  <p>Once girls have chosen the issue, they start planning their community event to raise awareness and make change. Global Girl Project teaches girls how to create change by turning their ideas into action.</p>
				  <p>For many of our girls, the education they receive doesn’t teach them how do this. Our program gives girls frameworks of a project plan, project budgets, etc and they work through these together. For most girls this is the first time they have taken ownership and responsibility for doing something like this.</p>
				  <p>Our girls organise events on self-chosen social issues, creating a platform for discussions with community members on important topics such as early marriage, education access, gang violence, drug use, waste disposal, and violence against women and girls.</p>
				  <p><strong>The events foster a change in attitude towards girls in families and communities, with lasting effects on beliefs about what girls can achieve.</strong> </p>
				<p>For example, two fathers in India changed their minds about their daughters' future after witnessing their event leadership, allowing them to complete school or delay marriage, a major shift from previous ideas of their daughters' role and future. These events are often the first time community members see girls leading and realise the potential for their leadership.</p>

					<h2>6. International network and ecosystem</h2>
					<p>After the girls graduate from the Global Girl Leadership Initiative, they join a wider group of graduates as part of Global Graduates Connect (GGC). This is a way for them to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Maintain a sense of belonging</li>
						<li>Get support from an international network</li>
						<li>Learn about other places and work with girls in other countries</li>
						<li>Be part of a global change movement</li>
					</ul>
					<p>GGC also provides girls with ongoing learning and further projects. It also offers opportunities they can be a part of, run by Global Girl Project, our partners, and the girls themselves.</p>

					<p>Our partners and program create significant impact: boosting our girls' confidence and self-worth, developing their leadership skills, and mobilising them to lead in their communities. They use their voice, speaking up about their needs and concerns, turning their ideas into reality, connecting them to a global network of girls for inspiration and support. They now see themselves as leaders! <a href="https://www.globalgirlproject.org/our-impact-1">Visit our Impact page to learn more.</a></p>
